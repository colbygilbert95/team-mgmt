# Go IPFS Core Team OKRs

We frame our ongoing work using a process based on quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Objectives reflect outcomes that are challenging, but realistic. Results are tangible and measurable.

## 2019 Q1

### Data transfer is fast and efficient
* It takes less than 48 hours to transfer 1TB dataset over Fast Ethernet (100Mbps)
* Bitswap refactor + improvements reduce number of duplicate blocks downloaded by 75%
 
### Adding and providing large data sets works efficiently
* Create Provider Strategies system that is solely responsible for providing
* Implement provider strategy such that a user can add (and provide) npm or tr-wikipedia without turning off providing and without significantly impacting finding content 

### Datastore works efficiently for large data sets
* Final go/no-go decision on Badger (full design comparison vs other options + final decision)
 
### go-ipfs becomes a well maintained project
* Every non-trivial PR is first reviewed by someone other than @Stebalien.
* A work-tracking process is adopted that allows the team to easily track the highest priority unclaimed issues, see the status of in progress work, and know which PRs need review, easily. 
 
### gx becomes a beloved tool by the Go Core Contributors Travis are you still working on this?
* go-ipfs doesn't have checked-in gx paths
 
### Complete outstanding endeavours that are still high priorities from Q3
* base32 is supported and enabled by default !
